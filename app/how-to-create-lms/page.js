Our concise guide to building a learning management system website (LMS) includes its capabilities and benefits. Let's explain LMS systems and their functions.

History of LMS projects
One American scientist published newspaper correspondence classes in stenography in the 18th century, introducing remote learning. This mechanism improved after 100 years, when feedback was possible. Teachers mailed lessons and assignments, while students returned completed homework. Video and audio cassette courses were the next phase in learning management system development. Computers were the most significant information technology advance. Multiple-machine local networks emerged after the computer's development. The Internet was the latest and most important stage in distance learning growth. This global network enhances information access. LMS platforms were created to address this. They let users train remotely, autonomously, and with several students at once. Learning management systems optimize learning and education delivery. LMS was created to improve eLearning. Today, organizations use LMS packages to improve staff training, tracking, and reporting to strengthen eLearning platform and analyze teamwork.

There are two main LMS sellers:
1. Hosted LMS
The owner deploys such a system on his host and can teach those affiliated with it. A first-generation LMS is still being used in universities. Large organizations prefer this type to govern and secure data.

2. SaaS/Cloud LMS
Content is loaded into the LMS host. Internet access is available to owners and users. This is the most frequent distant learning platform. To increase corporate learning, private online school owners and executives use it for its simplicity and convenience of use.
