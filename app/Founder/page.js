        Mishal Ahmad, the visionary behind Digital Whopper is a B.Tech graduate from the renowned Jaipur Engineering College & Research Center, Jaipur. With a passion for branding and marketing, he stepped into the professional world soon after completing his bachelor's in 2019 to become a digital marketing expert. He focused on gaining hands-on experience by working with real-time marketing projects. ‘TechIngenious’, known as the leading company in mobile and web app development helped him refine his IT skills. He further strengthened his roots in branding, understanding consumer behaviour, and overall digital marketing by working with ‘ClustersVeza’, a digital marketing agency in Jaipur. 
With years of experience, Mishal joined Cognizant, an IT company as a professional digital marketer. However, he always had a burning desire to create something valuable of his own – to become an entrepreneur. His dream became a reality when Zoya, his inspiration and better half supported his vision. Mishal’s passion for marketing, expertise in technology, and Zoya’s strategic capabilities served as pillars on which he laid the foundation of Digital Whopper (2020) and began his entrepreneurial journey. But walking this path wasn’t a ride as smooth as it seemed. 
Getting the first marketing project for a newly established company managed by a youngster was a challenge in itself. Mishal’s strong desire and focused efforts finally landed him his first freelancing marketing project – branding for Sahu Chai Wala, a local café. Keeping up with the expectations and ever-evolving demands of the client was another mountain to be climbed. But Mishal never gave up! 
The success of the marketing project of Sahu Chai Wala ignited a spark in Mishal that inspired him to keep marching ahead. From a one-man army, Digital Whopper was now managed by a small team of only 4 members – Mishal, Zoya, Deepak, and two others (employees). However, the progress came with its share of hurdles. Managing and motivating employees to keep working with high spirits in the budding stage of the company while simultaneously balancing client budgets was a tough task. It required a hell lot of patience, determination to keep going, and courage for experimentation. 
Gradually, Mishal learned the art of managing people. He built a culture where employees are free to experiment and let their thoughts shape with creativity. After getting multiple rejections from clients, Mishal leveraged some opportunities that define his achievements. 
Mishal’s work quality and ethics reflected his professional finesse that impressed clients. After building an extensive portfolio with brands like Mani, Mynsha Learning, KantinebyNamo and many more across diverse industries, they got a breakthrough with the success of Ekatra, recognised for its appearance in Shark Tank India. This gained Digital Whopper massive recognition and opened avenues for bigger opportunities. However, this also created pressure to deliver consistent and high-quality results and scale the team to meet new requirements. After 5 years of continuous hustle, another big leap was made in 2025. That’s when the company got recognition from the Government of Rajasthan and funding for its further expansion. 
What once began as a solo journey is now joined by more than 25 teammates who share a common vision. Mishal’s experience and result-oriented approach are the secret strategy behind the success of Digital Whopper. From a local café to nationally recognised businesses, having served more than 100 clients in different sectors, Mishal continues to lead with passion and purpose. Under his visionary leadership, Digital Whopper continues to lead the mission of helping businesses scale up in the online market. 
End of the journey? NO!! It’s just the beginning of something much bigger!
