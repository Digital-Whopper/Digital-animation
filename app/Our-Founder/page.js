<p className='text-[clamp(0.5rem,3vw,1 rem)] '>


    Mishal Ahmad, the visionary behind Digital Whopper is a B.Tech graduate with CSE Branch from the renowned Jaipur Engineering College & Research Center, Jaipur. 
He always focused on gaining hands-on experience by working with real-time marketing projects. So, he joined ‘TechIngenious’ (2019) to refine his IT skills and then ‘ClustersVeza’ to learn branding and digital marketing in and out. Then, he joined Cognizant as a professional digital marketer specialising in performance marketing and Google and Meta ads.
However, he always wanted to be the head of his marketing game. His dream became a reality when Zoya, his inspiration and better half supported his vision. Mishal’s passion for marketing, expertise in technology, and Zoya’s strategic capabilities served as pillars on which he laid the foundation of Digital Whopper (2020) and began his entrepreneurial journey. But walking this path wasn’t a ride as smooth as it seemed. 
Getting the first marketing project was a challenge in itself. But finally, Mishal’s consistent efforts landed him his first freelancing marketing project – branding for Sahu Chai Wala, a local café. 
Its success ignited a spark in Mishal that inspired him to keep marching ahead. From a one-man army, Digital Whopper was now managed by a small team of only 4 members – Mishal, Zoya, Deepak, and two others. However, managing HR with client budgets was a task that required a hell lot of patience. 
Gradually, Mishal learned the art of managing people. Projects by projects what seemed an endless journey, he got a breakthrough with the success of Ekatra, recognised for its appearance in Shark Tank India. After 5 years of continuous hustle, another big leap was made in 2025. That’s when the company got recognition from the Government of Rajasthan and funding for its further expansion. 
What once began as a solo journey is now joined by more than 25 teammates who share a common vision. From a local café to nationally recognised businesses, having served 100+ clients in different sectors, Mishal continues to lead with passion and purpose. Under his visionary leadership, Digital Whopper continues to help businesses scale up in the online market.

    Meet Our Second Founder 
</h2>

    Hi, Zoya here! I’m the investor cum second founder of Digital Whopper! Basically, I'm a 'behind-the-scenes' person.
I’ve always loved management and planning. Be it budgets or absolute chaos I was somehow able to find a way out. But only in cases of family parties or planning outings though… Never in my wildest of dreams I ever imagined, I’d become a founder of a company. 
But when I saw that desire and passion in Mishal’s eyes, I somehow couldn’t stop myself from jumping in… So yeah, now I was on a new mission. 
I genuinely wanted to support Mishal in every way I could. I managed the company’s operations and finances of Digital Whopper. I build a management system which ensured company’s smooth functioning. Being a social media addict myself I also took the task of managing socials for our brands.
From designing creative posts to making reels, from figuring out team problems to managing client budgets, I've been the centre head of marketing team. It was a roller coaster journey full of ups and downs. And also exciting as building your own company gives a satisfaction that can’t be described in words.

    Meet Our Co-Founder – Deepak Rajpurohit
</h2>

    Hi, I'm Deepak — co-founder and marketing head here at Digital Whopper. By degree, I'm a mechanical engineer. By choice, I'm a marketer. And by fate… probably just confused!
Now, here’s the plot twist: as a kid, I was absolutely obsessed with machines. Naturally, I joined mechanical engineering. Because, you know — when you're young and full of dreams, you make terrible life decisions.
Turns out, an engineering degree doesn't fuel your passion — it slowly converts it into depression. Yep, that's the best excuse I could come up with for jumping ship. Wink wink. So I changed my field — swapped grease-stained textbooks for marketing playbooks — and in 2022, I co-founded Digital Whopper.
Now I handle everything from ideation to execution. (Basically, I’m the guy who turns chaos into campaigns and KPIs). I’m not a perfectionist — far from it. But when it comes to marketing, I bring one thing consistently: passion.
You see, most marketers are either left-brained (data nerds) or right-brained (creative folks).
Me? I’m center-brained.
I don’t even know if that’s scientifically possible, but it sounds smart enough to put on this page. And look — I’m a Marwadi, yes. So people often assume I’m all about business, budgets, and bargaining for 5 rupees off.
But truth be told, I’m just a guy who loves building brands, learning every day, and laughing through the chaos. If you want to know how I do it (or just want a good marketing meme), you’re welcome to find me on socials. I promise I’m slightly more useful than my engineering degree.
